# Hello! This is a small MIPS assembly program I've written as a part of my Computer Organization class.
### This program is designed to take in two integer inputs as well as two character inputs to define the dimensions, border styling and fill characters respectively.
>An example input of 3 4 @ * would produce the following result:
>>@@@\
>>@ \* @\
>>@ \* @\
>>@@@

*This repository contains both the c file the assembly code is based on as well as the actual assembly code. This code was ran using QTSpim and has not been tested with any other software.*
